# To-do
A simple todo list app built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To continue expanding my skillset and learning more about building and interacting with APIs I built this todo list application. This is from Max Sandelin's walkthroughs where shows how to build API's using JavaScript. I learned a lot by following along throughout his video series and was able to expand my skillset quite a bit, I look forward to building my own APIs soon.

This to-do list API build is just a simple web application where the user can add items to their list, mark them as completed / uncompleted, and remove them. All information is then ultimately stored on a mySQL server.

Software Used:
* Web Languages
  - HTML
  - CSS
  
* Client-Side Languages
  - JavaScript
  - JSON
  
* Server-Side Languages
  - Node.js
  - mySQL

If you want to learn how to build this yourself you can check out the YouTube video that walks through the whole process here:
